## Arm Cloud Software Scavenger Hunt
Welcome to the October 2024 sweepstakes involving Arm cloud developers from around the globe! 
**Your mission:** Locate packages that work on Arm Linux servers (Aarch64) and bring them back to one central place: [The Software Ecosystem Dashboard for Arm](https://www.arm.com/developer-hub/ecosystem-dashboard/).
**Your reward:** Submitting at least one original contribution enters you into a sweepstakes to receive Arm SWAG and recognition of your findings!

### How do I get involved?
Simply contribute a package to the Software Ecosystem Dashboard for Arm through this GitHub repository! Simply follow this process below:

0. Ensure the package does not already exist on the dashboard and that it works on Arm Linux Servers. You'll need to prove it works on Arm in one of three ways:
   a. Cite release notes that note Arm Linux server (aarch64) support.
   b. Cite where Aarch64 binaries are downloadable.
   c. Manually validate the package runs on Arm by spinning up an Arm Neoverse-based server (such as an AWS Graviton instance) running Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, or SUSE preferred), install the package via package manager or binary (build from source as a last resort), and execute the package to ensure it runs (such as `package --version`). Cite your process during contribution.
1. Fork this repository
2. Add the package metadata
   a. Record relevant metadata, including citing how it works on Arm, in an .md file. The easiest approach is to copy an existing .md file and replace the information with this new package. For full details on metadata functions, read these [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/ecosystem-dashboard-for-arm/blob/main/contrib.md#required-information).
3. Make a Pull Request
   a. Be sure to check the box to join the sweepstakes!
   
Arm engineers will review your submission, ask questions if needed, and then accept your contribution! In a week or so it will appear on the public dashboard.

### When will I know if I won the sweepstakes results?
About 1-2 weeks after the sweepstakes ends at the end of the month. Your GitHub username will be mentioned in this repository; respond to us within 14 days of being mentioned and we'll send you your SWAG ) and recognition.
