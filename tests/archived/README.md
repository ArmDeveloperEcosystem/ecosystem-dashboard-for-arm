# Archived Documentation

This directory contains previous versions of the documentation that have been consolidated.

## Consolidation (November 17, 2025)

The documentation was consolidated from 9 files to 3 files for clarity and maintainability.

### New Structure (Current)

- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Quick navigation hub and 5-minute quick start
- **[COMPLETE_GUIDE.md](../COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive all-in-one guide
- **[PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md](../PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md)** - Advanced topics and troubleshooting

### Archived Files

These files are kept for historical reference:

| File | Original Purpose | Now Consolidated Into |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| **README-old.md** | General overview | README.md + COMPLETE_GUIDE.md |
| **QUICKSTART.md** | Tutorial (custom workflow) | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md |
| **QUICK-ADD-PACKAGE.md** | Fast reference (reusable workflow) | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md + README.md |
| **OVERVIEW.md** | System overview | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md |
| **SCALABLE-ARCHITECTURE.md** | Architecture details | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md |
| **PIPELINE-WALKTHROUGH.md** | Pipeline flow | PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md |
| **BADGE-INTEGRATION-FIX.md** | Troubleshooting | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md (troubleshooting section) |
| **DEPLOYMENT.md** | Deployment checklist | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md (deployment section) |
| **TEST-RESULTS-SCHEMA.md** | JSON schema | COMPLETE_GUIDE.md (schema section) |

### Why Consolidate?

**Problems with old structure:**
- 9 separate files caused confusion
- Redundant content across multiple files
- QUICKSTART.md taught outdated approach (custom workflows)
- Users didn't know which file to read first
- Difficult to maintain consistency

**Benefits of new structure:**
- Single source of truth (COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)
- Clear navigation (README.md)
- Current best practices only
- Easy to maintain
- Professional documentation structure
