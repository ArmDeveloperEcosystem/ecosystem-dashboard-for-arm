        rationale: This version introduces key performance and stability improvements alongside community-driven feature enhancements. The release simplifies Gradle build configurations, consolidates plugin management, and makes grails-wrapper a default, fully integrated feature. Applications now default to Java 11 with optional Java 17 support, and improvements reduce build artifacts and enhance YAML configurations. Several long-standing bugs were resolved, including fixes in scaffolding, asset pipeline, and field rendering. Dependency versions across the stack—including Groovy, Hibernate, and Tomcat—have been updated to ensure modern compatibility and reliability.
