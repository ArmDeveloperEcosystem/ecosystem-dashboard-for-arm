category: Networking
description: Kube-router is an all-in-one networking solution for Kubernetes that handles network routing, network policies, and service proxying using standard Linux networking tools. It replaces components like kube-proxy and kube-dns with a simpler, more efficient, and native approach to cluster networking. Designed for performance and simplicity, itâ€™s especially useful in bare-metal and performance-sensitive environments.
