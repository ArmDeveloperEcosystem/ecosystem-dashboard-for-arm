    rationale: Fedora Workstation 42 introduces official ISO images for Aarch64. This makes it easier to perform clean installations on Arm64 hardware, better suited for UEFI/Secure Boot, which is important for modern Arm servers/laptops, and more accessible for developers and users needing full installation control.
