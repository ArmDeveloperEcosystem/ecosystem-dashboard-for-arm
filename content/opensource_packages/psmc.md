name: PSMC (Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent)
category: Miscellaneous
description: PSMC (Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent) is a model used to infer the historical population sizes of species from a single genome. By examining patterns of genetic variation, it estimates population dynamics over time and is widely utilized for research on speciesâ€™ evolutionary history, particularly in human genetics.
