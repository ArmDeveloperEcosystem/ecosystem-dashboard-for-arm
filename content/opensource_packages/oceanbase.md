        rationale: OceanBase 4.2.5 LTS is a long-term support release tailored for mission-critical TP scenarios, delivering major gains in kernel stability, SQL engine performance, and high availability. It introduces full MySQL 5.7 compatibility, OBKV-Redis model support, enhanced diagnostics, and expanded backup/restore options (e.g., AWS S3, Huawei OBS). The release features optimized execution and parsing engines, new security controls, and improved usability via adaptive compaction and log stream management. Benchmarks show a 6â€“28% TP performance boost on 96-core clusters compared to v4.2.1.
