        rationale: This version delivers performance and stability improvements with a focus on stack reduction and Arm optimizations. The loop restoration filters (SGR and Wiener) have been rewritten to significantly lower stack usage, reducing it to 58â€¯KB on Arm and Aarch64. Key enhancements include improved loop restoration performance on Arm32 and Arm64, a new NEON-based implementation of load_tmvs for Aarch64, and overall efficiency gains. Additionally, the release addresses a rare potential deadlock issue in flush() to improve stability.
