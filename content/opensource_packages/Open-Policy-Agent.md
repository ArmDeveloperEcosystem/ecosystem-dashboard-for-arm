        rationale: This version introduces stricter Rego syntax defaults, requiring if and contains, and disallowing duplicate/shadowed imports. It delivers major memory optimizations, cutting allocations and improving evaluation speed by 10â€“20%. Test suite performance was significantly boosted, with topdown and storage/disk tests running 50% and 75% faster, respectively. Additional updates include support for scientific notation, customizable Prometheus metrics, and enhanced Rego v1 compatibility.
