    rationale: GDAL 3.11.0 is a major feature release introducing the new gdal front-end CLI (RFC 104), which consolidates multiple utilities including gdal raster calc, raster resclassify, and a significantly faster gdal raster tile (3â€“6x boost). It also ports key Python scripts (vsi list/copy/delete/move/sync) into native CLI tools and adds driver-specific commands via gdal driver. Smart Bash autocompletion and full C/C++/Python API support are included. A notable new feature is the GDALG driver, enabling streamed, replayable vector dataset execution from CLI-style workflows, similar to a VRT format.
