        rationale: Quartz 2.4.0 now requires Java 8+ and has migrated its build system from Maven to Gradle. Several third-party dependencies like SLF4J, Log4j, and Hikari have been upgraded. Maven POMs generated via Gradle now declare dependencies with "provided" scope for cleaner integration. The release removes the legacy TerracottaJobStore and the NativeJob class from quartz-jobs due to security risksâ€”now relocated as example15. Example programs can be easily run using Gradle, with guidance provided in the updated examples_guide.txt.
