        rationale: Following the official Scala highlights from 2024 in the reference content, version 3.5 and 3.6 are the most recommended by Scala team. Scala 3.5 introduces support for var in refinements, binary integer literals, and experimental named tuples. Named tuples is a significant addition to the language as it allows to give meaningful names to tuple elements. These names can be used during construction, selection and pattern matching. The banner change in Scala 3.6 is the new syntax for context bounds and givens, improving both power and ergonomics. Scala 3.6 also includes support for multiple type parameter lists, and improvements to for desugaring.
