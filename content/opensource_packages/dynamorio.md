        rationale: DynamoRIO 9.0.1 introduces key enhancements and broader platform compatibility. A major addition is the experimental -attach option in drrun for attaching to running processes (currently x86-only). The release significantly improves AArch64 (ARM64) support and adds a new library for Linux-based application callstack walking. Support was also added for running mixed-bitwidth child processes (e.g., 32-bit under 64-bit) and preliminary execution under QEMU. These features extend DynamoRIOâ€™s dynamic instrumentation capabilities across more environments and use cases.
