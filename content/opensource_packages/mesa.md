        rationale: This version is a feature-rich release that stabilizes the discrete space modeling system, enabling real-time cell manipulation and integration with PropertyLayers for spatial environmental properties. The SolaraViz visualization toolkit receives major upgrades, including an interactive command console, asynchronous rendering, dark mode, and enhanced UI navigation. Tutorials have been restructured into modular, progressive notebooks for easier learning. A major conceptual addition is meta-agents, allowing users to model hierarchical agent structures like organizations or ecosystems. Key examples demonstrate dynamic alliance formation and structured meta-agent modeling.
