        rationale: SUSE Virtualization 1.5 brings full GA support for VM management on Arm64-based Kubernetes clusters running on Ampere infrastructure. With SLES 15 SP5 as the underlying OS, users gain not only compatibility but also efficiencyâ€”thanks to its support for 64K kernel page sizes. This combination provides a high-performance foundation for virtualization on Arm64, making SUSE Virtualization 1.5 both production-ready and cloud-native friendly.
