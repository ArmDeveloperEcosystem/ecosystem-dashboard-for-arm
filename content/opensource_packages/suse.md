    support_caveats: There are minimum hardware requirements to install SUSE on Arm hardware. For all details, read [this install guide from SUSE](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/cha-aarch64.html). SUSE SLES is built on an open-source codebase, meaning its core is freely available and modifiable. However, access to official updates, patches, maintenance, and enterprise support requires a paid subscription after the initial free trial.

        rationale: SUSE Virtualization 1.5 brings full GA support for VM management on Arm64-based Kubernetes clusters running on Ampere infrastructure. With SLES 15 SP5 as the underlying OS, users gain not only compatibility but also efficiencyâ€”thanks to its support for 64K kernel page sizes. This combination provides a high-performance foundation for virtualization on Arm64, making SUSE Virtualization 1.5 both production-ready and cloud-native friendly.
