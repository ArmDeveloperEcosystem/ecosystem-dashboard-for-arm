        rationale: This version refines daily workflows with a redesigned Style Book that now supports Classic themes, allowing centralized control over site styles. It introduces speculative loading for near-instant page transitions and enhances security with bcrypt password hashing. Over 100 accessibility fixes improve navigation, labeling, and editor usability. Performance gets a major lift through query caching, block editor optimizations, and a new Interactivity API aiming for sub-50ms responses. This release strengthens speed, security, and customizationâ€”without requiring user intervention.
