        rationale: Calico now supports a tech-preview nftables dataplane, offering native Linux policy enforcement with enhanced kernel integration. Felix's route resync logic has been optimized, using 50% less CPU time and 80% less memory, significantly improving efficiency on Linux nodes. eBPF improvements include fixes for memory leaks, dual-stack compatibility, and enhanced ICMP and VXLAN traffic handling, improving network stability under load. Calico now sets Goâ€™s GC threshold to 40%, reducing CPU usage, and exposes GOMAXPROCS for tuning CPU-bound performance.
