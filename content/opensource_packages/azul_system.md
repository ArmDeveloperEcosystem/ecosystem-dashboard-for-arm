    rationale: Azul's Zulu OpenJDK now includes full CRaC support and the Warp Engine on Linux for Arm 64-bit systems (using GLIBC) for versions 17, 21 and 24 released after July 2025. This technology significantly cuts down Java application startup time by restoring an application from a saved checkpoint.
