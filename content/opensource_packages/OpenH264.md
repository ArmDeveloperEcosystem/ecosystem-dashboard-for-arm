        rationale: Version 2.1.1 already has rolled out arm and arm64 linux libraries. However, OpenH264 v2.5.0 brings a series of stability, performance, and compatibility improvements. It resolves several multi-threaded decoding issues and fixes a deadlock that could occur at the end of decoding, enhancing reliability in concurrent processing environments. Frame decode errors are also addressed, ensuring more accurate video playback. The release includes build system updates such as Meson build support for riscv64 and PAC/BTI (Pointer Authentication and Branch Target Identification) security enhancements. Additionally, it fixes cross-compilation from Darwin arm64 to x86_64 and resolves a specific decoding bug affecting H.264 streams encoded by Appleâ€™s hardware encoder.
