        rationale: This version introduces several performance improvements, particularly for Arm64/Aarch64 platforms. It includes new NEON optimizations delivering 1â€“3% speedups for real-time (RTC) encoding and up to 7% gains for high bitdepth video-on-demand (VoD) workloads. The update also resolves numerous platform-specific issues, including build failures on Aarch64.
