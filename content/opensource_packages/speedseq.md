    other_info: There are no release notes available for Linux/ARM64. Even the master branch fails to build from source on Neoverse N1, locating emmintrin.h file, which comes pre-installed on x86-64 only. Kindly consider this comment in one of the vkQuake3 [tickets](https://github.com/suijingfeng/vkQuake3/issues/14#issuecomment-674390549). This file isn't available on AArch64.
