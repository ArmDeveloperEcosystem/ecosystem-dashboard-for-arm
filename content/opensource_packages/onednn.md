        rationale: This release delivers significant performance and usability improvements for AArch64-based processors. Performance enhancements include improved bf16 matrix multiplication (matmul) with fp32 destination using the Arm Compute Library (ACL), as well as better performance for bf16-to-fp32 reordering, bf16 reordering in general, and bf16 convolution operations via ACL. On the usability front, the release adds support for ACLâ€™s ThreadpoolScheduler through thread_local configuration, fixes a memory inefficiency by enabling proper use of scratchpad memory in ACL matmuls, and makes the ACL matmul primitive thread-safe to support concurrent execution. Together, these changes enhance both computational throughput and multi-threaded execution efficiency on Arm-based platforms.
