    rationale: Eclipse Temurin JDK 21+ releases are now fully reproducible for many platforms, including Linux Aarch64. This ensures nothing malicious or unexpected is embedded in the binaries. This is a major milestone for transparency, security, and trustworthiness, especially for environments like Linux/Arm64 where deterministic builds can reduce platform-specific bugs.
