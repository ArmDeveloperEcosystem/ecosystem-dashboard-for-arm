    other_info: Apbs fails to build on Linux/ARM64 for locating BLAS. The maintainer had a comment in one of the tickets raised for Mac AArch64 support, explaining they will probably never add additional platform support as they lack financial support and volunteers. Kindly find the conversation [here](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs/issues/289#issuecomment-2073988774).
