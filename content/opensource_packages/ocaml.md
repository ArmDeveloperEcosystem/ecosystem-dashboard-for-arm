        rationale: This release introduces several notable enhancements and refinements across the language and runtime. Key highlights include new syntax for deep effect handlers, the restoration of the MSVC port, and the reintroduction of statistical memory profiling (statmemprof). The release also adds support for UTF-8 encoded Unicode source files and limited Unicode identifiers, along with a more space-efficient implementation of Dynarray. Developer tooling sees improvements as well, notably with enhanced metadata for declarations and definitions in Merlin. Additionally, the release brings about 20 new standard library functions, numerous runtime fixes, and improved error messages for modules, functors, and type clashes, reinforcing OCamlâ€™s focus on usability and performance.
