    other_info: There are no official release notes or announcements for the initial Linux/Arm64 support. The Arm support in Chromium is gradual, with the first public build for the Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) repository being 53.0.2785.143-0ubuntu0.16.04.1.1257. This version was later superseded by newer builds pushed as part of the security update cycle.
