    support_caveats: Application Performance Monitoring (APM) provides a unified monitoring service for all the apps and microservices. New Relic provides the APM agents like PHP, java, go, ruby, python, node.js and .NET. New Relic instruments the application at the code level through use of one of the language agents. These agents collect metrics from the application and send them to New Relic APM, allowing the user to monitor the application using pre-built dashboards. ARM64 releases for these agents can be found [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/support-arm-graviton-x86-64/).
