name: Icarus Verilog
category: EDA
description: Icarus Verilog is an open-source Verilog compiler and simulator that implements the IEEE 1364 Verilog HDL standard and a subset of SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800). Rather than functioning solely as a traditional simulator, it serves as a compiler that generates code for use by back-end tools in digital design workflows.
