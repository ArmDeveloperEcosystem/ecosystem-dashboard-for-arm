description: Qflow is an open-source digital ASIC synthesis flow that takes Verilog to physical layout by integrating tools like Yosys for synthesis, GrayWolf for placement, and Qrouter for routing. It provides a fully open toolchain for standard-cell–based chip design, suitable for small to mid-scale digital circuits.
